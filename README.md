You need to create an AWS lambda function to do the following:
Create a RESTful API which executes the following steps for every request

a. Pull data from this url (Microsoft edge): https://gbfs.divvybikes.com/gbfs/en/station_information.json

b. Make some changes to the output from the url above:
    1. Remove rental_methods and rental_uris from the output.
    2. Rename: external_id, station_id, and legacy_id into externalId, stationId, and legacyId.
    3. Return the data when the capacity is less than 12.

c. Convert your JSON output into CSV.
d. Write your output into a filesystem as a .csv file.
