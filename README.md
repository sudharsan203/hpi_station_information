# Building a Restful CRUD API with Node.js, Hapi and MongoDB #
## We’ll be building a RESTful CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) API with Node.js, Hapi and MongoDB. ##

*Hapi.js* (shorthand for Http-API, pronounced happy and also known as hapi) is an open-source Node.js framework used to build powerful and scalable web applications.

We’ll use Mongoose for interacting with the MongoDB instance.
Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapping) tool for Node.js and MongoDB. It helps you convert the objects in your code to documents in the database and vice versa. 

## Prerequisites:  
Please install MongoDB in your machine if you have not done already. Checkout the official MogngoDB installation manual for any help with the installation.

### Our Application ###
We will be building a simple Notes application. We will build Rest APIs for creating, listing, editing and deleting a Note.  

We’ll start by building a simple web server and then move on to configuring the database, building the Note model and different routes for handling all the CRUD operations.  

### Installation ###
```
$ npm install
```
